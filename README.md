📈 Stock Prediction Agent
This project is a production-ready stock prediction agent that uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model to forecast stock prices. The agent is containerized using Docker, making it easy to deploy and scale in various cloud environments.

🚀 Getting Started
These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

Prerequisites
You'll need the following installed on your machine:

Docker: To build and run the application in a container.

Git: To clone this repository.

Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/stock-prediction-agent.git
cd stock-prediction-agent
Build the Docker image:
This command builds the Docker image and tags it as stock-prediction-agent.

Bash

docker build -t stock-prediction-agent .
Run the container locally:
This command runs the container and maps port 5000 on your machine to port 5000 inside the container.

Bash

docker run -p 5000:5000 stock-prediction-agent
The Flask API will now be running at http://localhost:5000. You can send prediction requests to this endpoint.

Key Technologies
TensorFlow: For building and running the LSTM model.

scikit-learn: For data preprocessing and scaling.

Flask & Gunicorn: A lightweight web server framework and a robust production-ready WSGI server for the API.

Pandas & NumPy: Essential libraries for data manipulation and numerical operations.

yfinance: To fetch real-time stock data.

Docker: To containerize the application for consistent environments.

☁️ Cloud Deployment
This agent is designed for easy deployment to cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure. The following are conceptual steps for deploying on AWS.

1. Push to AWS ECR
First, you need to create a repository in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) and push your Docker image.

Bash

# 1. Create a repository
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name stock-prediction-agent

# 2. Tag your local image
docker tag stock-prediction-agent:latest <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<your-region>.amazonaws.com/stock-prediction-agent:latest

# 3. Push the image to ECR
docker push <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<your-region>.amazonaws.com/stock-prediction-agent:latest
2. Deployment on AWS ECS / AWS Lambda
Once the image is in ECR, you can deploy it using services like AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) or AWS Lambda.

ECS: A good choice for running the API with high availability and scalability. Use a Fargate launch type to avoid managing EC2 instances.

Lambda: Suitable for an on-demand, serverless API. You would configure a Lambda function to use the container image from ECR.

🛠️ Monitoring & Maintenance
A robust strategy is in place to ensure the model remains performant and the service is reliable.

Logging & Metrics:

AWS CloudWatch: Used for collecting operational logs and monitoring key metrics.

Custom Logging: The app.py includes custom logging to capture prediction inputs and outputs, which is crucial for auditing and debugging.

Performance Evaluation:

A scheduled task (e.g., a Lambda function or ECS Task) can be triggered daily or weekly to run a performance evaluation script against new market data.

Automated Retraining:

An automated retraining pipeline, possibly triggered by a cron job or a CloudWatch event, can be used to update the model with new data periodically.

CI/CD Pipeline:

A CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) automates the build, test, and deployment process, ensuring that new code changes are seamlessly deployed to production.
